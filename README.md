## General Information

The Pizza Party Game Prototype is a multiplayer arcade-style game where two players compete to collect as many pizzas as possible within a time limit, all while avoiding obstacles. The goal of this project is to create an engaging, competitive game that highlights fast-paced action and easy-to-learn mechanics. It is designed to be accessible to players of all ages and focuses on creating a balance between challenge and enjoyment.

The game was undertaken as part of a learning project to explore game development concepts, user experience, and balancing game difficulty to maintain player engagement.

## Technologies Used
Microsoft MakeCode Arcade - version 1.6

## Features
Multiplayer Mode: Two players can play simultaneously, competing against each other.

Timed Gameplay: Each game is 60 seconds long, adding urgency to collect pizzas.

Obstacle Avoidance: Players must avoid moving obstacles that add complexity to the gameplay.

Visual and Audio Feedback: Positive feedback for pizza collection and winning the game through sound and visuals.

## Setup
A web browser that supports HTML5.

Microsoft MakeCode Arcade environment for code modifications.

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pizza-party.git

Open Microsoft MakeCode Arcade.

Import the Project: Load the cloned files into MakeCode to view and modify the code.

Run Locally: Use MakeCode's built-in emulator to test and play the game.

## Usage
Players use the default arrow keys for Player 1 and WASD for Player 2 to move their characters around the screen. The 'A' button is used to collect pizzas once they are within reach.

Example code snippet for movement control:

controller.moveSprite(player1);

controller.player2.moveSprite(player2);

The objective is to collect as many pizzas as possible while avoiding obstacles. When the game ends, the player with the most pizzas wins.

## Project Status
Project is: in progress. The game prototype is functional but will continue to be refined based on player feedback.

## Room for Improvement

Obstacle Behavior: Enhance the movement patterns of obstacles for a more challenging experience.

Visual Enhancements: Improve character and background graphics for better visual appeal.

## To-Do List

Power-Ups: Add items that provide temporary boosts to player speed or score.

Enhanced Sound Effects: Include more diverse sound effects for a richer audio experience.

## Acknowledgements
